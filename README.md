# NDSLabs Service Catalog

## Documentation
For more information about the specs: [NDS Labs Service Specification](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/confluence/display/NDS/NDS+Labs+Service+Specification).

## Adding a New Spec
To add a new service to NDS Labs, you only need:
* a Docker Image
* a Docker Hub account
* a JSON object describing your image that conforms to the above specification

For some tutorials on how to add a new spec to a running instance of NDS Labs, see [developer-tutorial](https://github.com/nds-org/developer-tutorial).

## Contributing a Spec
Have you created and tested a spec of your own? Want to see it end up in NDS Labs for others to use?

That's great!

### Share Your Spec
Simply sharing the JSON spec you have created with others will allow them to add the service to their running instance to run using your pushed Docker image.

### Make a Pull Request
Just fork this repository, add your service spec, and create a pull request!
